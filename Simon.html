        <h1>About Simon Smith</h1>
        <p>Simon M. Smith graduated from the University of Toronto in 1980, with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics, and later received a Masters of Business Administration in Marketing and Finance in 1982 from his Alma Matter. His experience in the Petroleum industry began in 1981 at Imperial Oil Ltd., the Canadian subsidiary of ExxonMobil Corporation. As his time at Imperial Oil progressed, rising to the position of Manager of Supply, he was transferred to the Marketing Manager for Esso France (ExxonMobil’s European Brand). Where he served for two years before moving to Belgium in 1999, and entering the role of Marketing Manager for European Operations. After his time in Europe concluded in 2001, he was transferred back to Toronto entering the position of Vice-President and General Manager of Fuels Marketing for Imperial Oil Limited, and overseeing all operations pertaining to fuels marketing throughout Imperial Oil. He would split time in this position between Toronto, Ontario, and Calgary, Alberta. On June 1st, 2011, he was transferred to Washington D.C., where he took on the position of Retail Director for North America, later having his position expanded to Retail Director of the Americas for ExxonMobil Corporation in April of 2012. At the time of his retirement in 2013, he oversaw ExxonMobil’s entire retail operations for North and South America which included a network of over 12,000 retail sites and 800KBD in fuels sales all under the Exxon, Mobil, and Esso brands. Mr. Smith’s position also included all areas of ExxonMobil’s downstream sector that pertained to Fuels Marketing. As well as his time at ExxonMobil, Mr. Smith was the Chair of the Marketing Sub-Committee of the American Petroleum Institute, and Former Director of the Canadian Fuels Association. Simon’s time at ExxonMobil and his positions on various Associations and committees, provides unique insight into the Canadian Athabasca Oil Sands, and Imperial Oil’s cultivation, refinement, and sale of extra-heavy crude oil from the Kearl Oil Sands. 
        Today’s media debate surrounding the tar-sand cultivation, and energy dependence, Mr. Smith’s opinions on the debate can help clarify the perspective of the Petroleum industry, and help people grasp both sides of a relevant debate. The realities and economics surrounding the extra-heavy crude production of tar sands, is a portion of the argument that can, at sometimes be lost in the media’s portrayal of operations in the tar-sands. The environmental impact of cultivation of the tar sands is an important issue, and an aspect that this interview will attempt to grasp as it is the central topic in the public debate. This interview will attempt to shed light on the necessity, cost, and other realities of the Athabasca Oil Sands operations (specifically the Kearl Oil Sands), and provide deeper insight into the situation that currently surrounds the tar-sands.
        Mr. Smith’s position in Marketing will also help to gain a deeper understanding on the economics surrounding the tar-sands, and its relation to the United States’ energy dependence on so called “foreign oil”. The current debate surrounding the XL Keystone pipeline can also be inquired upon, as his position of distribution and sales would have directly exposed him to the benefits and costs of constructing the highly controversial pipeline project currently proposed to the United States Government. </p>
